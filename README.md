##Nepali-text-to-speech


This was a bachelor project created arround 2006.  The text to speech system contains two module.  The TTSCommand.java just converts the nepali text to sequence of unicode along with some processing. The voice.pl is a perl module which reads this unicode file and converrts it to voice. Voice is generated by concating the unit files contained in speechDB folder. A utility program called SFCAT is used to join the file to create the sound file for the sentence.

  Note:
  The current version accepts only a single sentence, ie a line ended by "Pruna biram" (Nepali fullstop)
